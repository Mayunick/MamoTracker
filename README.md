# MamoTracker

MamoTracker is a simple tool to help you keep track of your progress of how many episode of anime you've watched or how many of volume of manga you've read, no account required.

To build a static page for electron to use, cd into `app` and run `npm run build`.

To package the app, remove the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` in `app`, and run `npm run build`.

Any suggestion is welcomed.
